You need to keep borders weed-free during winter mainly, because when your spring flowering bulbs and border plants start to flower, the borders will be much more difficult (more time consuming) to weed. Also, people donâ€™t realize that many weeds are seasonal. Weeds grow more weeds. Regular weeding means less weeding.</p>
